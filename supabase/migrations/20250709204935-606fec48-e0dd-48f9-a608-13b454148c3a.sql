  'Sales Objection Handling',
  'Common objections and responses:

OBJECTION: "We use Google Translate"
RESPONSE: "Google Translate gives literal translations. We provide culturally-aware translations that actually convert customers. For example, our Urban Dictionary integration catches slang and context that Google misses completely."

OBJECTION: "Too expensive"
RESPONSE: "One human translator costs $0.15-0.30 per word. Our platform translates unlimited words for a flat monthly fee. A single page translation that costs $500 with humans is included in our $19.99/month plan."

OBJECTION: "We don''t need translations yet"
RESPONSE: "75% of online consumers prefer to buy in their native language. You''re losing potential customers every day. Our live demo can show you exactly how much traffic you could capture."

OBJECTION: "Worried about mistakes"
RESPONSE: "That''s exactly why we have live editing - you see and control every translation. Plus our 50% money-back guarantee protects you completely."',
